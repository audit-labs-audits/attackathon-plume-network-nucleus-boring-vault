The `_validityCheck()` function reverted due to an external condition, like a Layer 2 sequencer being down.\n\nC).

The time elapsed since the oracle's last price update has exceeded the configured `MAX_TIME_FROM_LAST_UPDATE` threshold.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is that the time since the last update exceeded the configured maximum. The check `block.timestamp - lastUpdatedAt > MAX_TIME_FROM_LAST_UPDATE` on line 106 explicitly compares the current block's timestamp to the `lastUpdatedAt` value from the oracle.
